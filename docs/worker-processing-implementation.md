# Worker Processing Control Implementation

## Overview
Implemented complete control for background worker processing in Task Genius plugin, allowing users to enable/disable worker threads for file parsing performance optimization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Settings UI Integration (`IndexSettingsTab.ts`)
- Updated the "Enable worker processing" toggle to use the new `fileSource.performance.enableWorkerProcessing` setting path
- Added backward compatibility with legacy `fileParsingConfig.enableWorkerProcessing` setting
- Ensures proper initialization of setting structure when needed

### 2. WorkerOrchestrator Enhancement (`WorkerOrchestrator.ts`)
- Added `enableWorkerProcessing` configuration option to constructor
- Implemented `setWorkerProcessingEnabled()` method for dynamic control
- Added `isWorkerProcessingEnabled()` status check method
- Enhanced `getMetrics()` to provide comprehensive performance statistics
- Circuit breaker automatically resets when re-enabling workers

### 3. DataflowOrchestrator Integration (`Orchestrator.ts`)
- Reads worker processing setting from both new and legacy paths
- Passes configuration to WorkerOrchestrator during initialization
- Added `updateSettings()` method to propagate setting changes
- Added `getWorkerStatus()` for monitoring worker state and metrics

### 4. Settings Update Flow (`setting.ts`)
- Modified `applySettingsUpdate()` to call `dataflowOrchestrator.updateSettings()`
- Ensures worker processing changes take effect immediately without restart

### 5. FileSource Management (`FileSource.ts`)
- Added `cleanup()` method for proper resource cleanup
- Added `updateConfig()` alias for configuration updates
- Properly handles initialization and cleanup based on settings

## How It Works

1. **User toggles setting**: User changes "Enable worker processing" in Index Settings
2. **Setting saved**: New value stored in `fileSource.performance.enableWorkerProcessing`
3. **Update propagated**: `applySettingsUpdate()` calls `dataflowOrchestrator.updateSettings()`
4. **Worker control**: `WorkerOrchestrator.setWorkerProcessingEnabled()` updates worker state
5. **Processing mode**: Tasks are processed either by workers or main thread based on setting

## Benefits

- **Performance Control**: Users can disable workers if experiencing issues
- **Dynamic Updates**: Changes take effect immediately without plugin restart
- **Backward Compatibility**: Works with both old and new setting paths
- **Circuit Breaker**: Automatic recovery when re-enabling workers
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics for debugging and optimization

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite (`worker-processing-control.test.ts`) that verifies:
- Default enabled state
- Configuration respect on initialization
- Dynamic enabling/disabling
- Circuit breaker reset behavior
- Metrics availability
- Settings path fallback logic

All tests pass successfully, confirming proper implementation.
